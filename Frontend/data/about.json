    "about": "Hello there! I am Aditya Mishra, a Physics student at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I am a passionate programmer and tech enthusiast. I love to fiddle around with new technologies (one big example is the very website you see!) aaaand to spend countless hours to automate my teensy tasks, like a true OCD-haver. On most days I can be found sleeping, but once in a blue moon, when I wake up, I am found doom scrolling on Instagram (damn you Meta algorithm). Jokes aside, I love to work on developing softwares, high-performance data pipelines and generative AI projects. Please visit Projects page to learn more about my ventures!",
